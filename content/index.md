# welcome to my notes!

this site is designed to host notes i take during my time studying computer science at the [university of bath](https://bath.ac.uk).
to begin, choose a module from the sidebar (*inside `001 bath`*) to see it's notes. ([[001 bath/CM12003 programming 1/02 - functions|try me!]])
you can also read about my [[notetaking style]].

***have fun!***
