title: my notetaking style
---

i prefer a mix of long-form notes and smaller, *topic-specific* notes.
i tend to start a new note for each lecture using the same **template**, and use this to take down notes as i'm listening to the lecturer. i try to take notes down as though i'm trying to teach a past version of me, so i stick to a **slightly informal**, but **information-dense** style, and use callouts to draw my attention to important stuff. during the lecture i'll create links to notes that *might not yet exist*, for example for keywords.
at a later date, i'll then *review these notes*, and try to fill out as many of these empty links as i can by creating **smaller notes** that describe the topic in more consise terms. sometimes, a note is too complex to be simplified, so often in this case i'll just *yank my notes on the topic from the lecture* into their own note, and *embed it back into the lecture notes*. 
i think that doing this is helpful, as it serves as a form of [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition), and helps me to revise my notes to keep the topic fresh in my mind.
