#binary
[[binary]], or *base 2* is a number system that uses only two digits: 0 and 1.
it is commonly used to represent data in computer systems because it can be easily represented using electronic switches that are either on (1) or off (0), which makes it a convenient choice for digital computers.
a *bit* is the basic unit of information in binary, and it can have a value of either 0 or 1. a group of bits is often referred to as a *byte*, which is typically eight bits long.
