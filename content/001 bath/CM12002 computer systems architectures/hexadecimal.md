[[hexadecimal]] is a base-16 number system that uses 16 distinct symbols: 0-9 to represent values zero through nine, and a-f to represent values ten through fifteen. this system is commonly used in computer programming, as a nibble can be represented by a single hexadecimal digit. this makes it easy to express binary data in a more human-readable form. for example, the binary data `0b11010101` can be represented as the hexadecimal number `0xd5`. hexadecimal is also often used to represent colors in web design, with codes like `#ffffff` representing white and `#000000` representing black.
