## logic gates
a digital circuit is constructed using a number of **[[logic gates]]**. a logic gate is a basic circuit that performs one of the base [[02 - boolean logic#logic connectives|logical connectives]].
there are **three** base gates:
+ AND gate (logical conjunction)
+ OR gate (logical disjunction)
+ NOT gate (logical negation)
