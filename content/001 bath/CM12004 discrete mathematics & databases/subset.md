#sets 
a set $A$ is a *[[subset]]* of set $B$ (denoted $A\subset B$), if **every element in $A$ is also a element in $B$** ($\forall x \in A (x \in B)$).
> [!EXAMPLE]
> let $A=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\ \&\ B=\{2,4,6\}$. $B$ is then a **subset** of $A$ ($B\subset A$) as every element in $B$ is also in element A.
