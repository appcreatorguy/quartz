#boolean 
a **boolean formula** is a string of symbols from the set $\{X_1,\ldots ,X_n,\land ,\lor , \implies , \neg , (,)\}$ 
it is organised with the following rules:
1. any variable $X_i,(1\leq i \leq n)$ is a boolean formula
2. if $F$ and $G$ are two boolean formulae, then $(F\land G),(F\lor G), (F\implies G), (\neg F)$ are all boolean formulae.
3. $F$ and $G$ may each themselves be additional boolean formulae
*usually, the outermost parentheses are dropped.*
