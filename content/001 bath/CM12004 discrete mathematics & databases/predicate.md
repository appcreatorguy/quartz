#logic 
a [[predicate]] is a "variable" [[proposition]]. it is a statement that depends on one or more variables from a [[set]].
defining this [[set]]'s elements turns the [[predicate]] into a definite [[proposition]] that can be either true or false.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> the expression $x+1>x$ is a [[predicate]]. it is only a [[proposition]] once we define the set it is true for, for example $\forall x$.
