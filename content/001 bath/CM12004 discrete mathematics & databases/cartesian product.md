#sets 
for two sets $A$ and $B$ the [[cartesian product]] of the two sets is a set of pairs obtained by **combining elements from the two sets in every possible combination**. it's denoted by the multiplication symbol ($A\times B$).
the [[cartesian product]] can be visualised easily using a table:

for example, if $A=\{x_1,x_2\}$ and $B=\{y_1,y_2\}$ then $A\times B=\{(x_1,y_1),(x_1,y_2),(x_2,y_1),(x_2,y_2)\}$.
