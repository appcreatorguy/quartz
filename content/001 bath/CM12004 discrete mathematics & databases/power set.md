#sets 
a [[power set]] contains the empty set, and then a [[set]] for every combination of elements in a given [[set]]. it's denoted by $P(A)$, or $2^A$ (which is a hint at the number of elements it contains)
> [!EXAMPLE]
> let $A=\{a,b,c\}$.
> the [[power set]] of $A$ is then: $2^A=\{\varnothing,\{a\},\{b\},\{c\},\{a,b\},\{a,c\},\{b,c\},\{a,b,c\}\}$

>[!TIP]
> dont't forget that the [[power set]] also includes the *empty set* as well!
