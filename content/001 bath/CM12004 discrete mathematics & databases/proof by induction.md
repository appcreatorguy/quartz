#proof #induction
proof by induction is a method of proof that allows us to prove that a statement is true for all natural numbers. it works by showing that the statement is true for the smallest natural number, and then showing that if it is true for some natural number, it is also true for the next natural number. a proof follows four basic stages:
+ **base.** prove that the statement is true when $n$ is the smallest number.
+ **inductive hypothesis.** assume that the statement is true for $n$.
+ **inductive step.** prove that the statement is also true for $n+1$
+ **conclusion.** thus we know that the statement is true $\forall\mathbb{Z}$.
